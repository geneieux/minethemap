MineTheMap: Open-source project fusing gaming (Pok√©mon Go, SimCity, Clash of Clans) with Google Maps for real-world property data. We reward collectors with fiat/stablecoin for verified, granular data, inverting portals' free model. Solve "poor input = poor output" via gamification &amp; blockchain authentication. Devs &amp; node operators welcome!
